        This documentation is currently a work in progress and is still rough
        around the edges. Not finding what you are looking for? Please open an
        issue describing your troubles on `python-twitch's github page`_!


You are welcome to contribute. Post your issues on `python-twitch's github
page`_ with your feature suggestions and your problems.

Pull requests are required to be compatible with both Python 2.7 and recent
versions of Python 3. To help you ensure good code quality CI is automatically
testing all PR's and tells you if something is wrong with them.

.. note::
        
        TODO: the document should also talk about style (flake8) and the necessity
        of adding tests to cover all code changes.
